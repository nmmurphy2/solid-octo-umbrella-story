There once was an armadillo named Frank. He lived in Dallas, Texas and enjoyed listening to music.
One day he listened to Justin Bieber's Baby song.

Although he had enjoyed listening to music, there was never a song that moved him to tears. This song was different. Frank immediately started to cry out of joy.

After the song ended, and Frank realized it was over Frank wanted more, and began to search for other Justin Bieber songs.

His internet died. He cried again.

Once he got his internet up and running once again, his web browser popped up with a link to a Stevie Ray Vaughan song "Lenny". He listened to it thinking this is nothing like the Justin Beiber song. As he listened he realized that this was in fact the best music ever created and he needed more. He learned that Stevie was originally from Dallas and looked for any concert dates. He eventually learned that all the best musicians are already dead and he began to cry once again. He decided he was going to do something about this and started his own blues band named Frank and the Armadillos. They were a huge hit and sparked a new rise in blues music today.
The End.
