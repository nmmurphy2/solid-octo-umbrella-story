There once was an armadillo named Frank. He lived in Dallas, Texas and enjoyed listening to music.
One day he listened to Justin Bieber's Baby song.

Although he had enjoyed listening to music, there was never a song that moved him to tears. This song was different. Frank immediately started to cry out of joy.
